            <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
            <p>Ada Lovelace has been called the world's first computer programmer.
                 What she did was write the world’s first machine algorithm for an early computing 
                 machine that existed only on paper. Of course, someone had to be the first, 
                 but Lovelace was a woman, and this was in the 1840s. Lovelace was a brilliant
                  mathematician, thanks in part to opportunities that were denied most women of 
                  the time.
                  Ada Byron was a teenager when she met Cambridge mathematics professor Charles Babbage,
                   who had invented the Difference Engine, a mechanical computer designed to produce 
                   mathematical tables automatically and error-free. Babbage never built the actual 
                   machine due to personal setbacks and financing difficulty. By 1834 he had moved
                    on to design his Analytical Engine, the first general purpose computer, which 
                    used punch cards for input and output. This machine also lacked financing and 
                    was never built.

                    In 1842, Babbage gave a lecture on the engine at the University of Turin. Luigi Menabrea, 
                    a mathematician transcribed the lecture in French. Ada was commissioned to translate the 
                    transcript into English. and added her own notes to the lecture, which ended up being
                     three times as long as the actual transcript. It was published in 1843. 


Lovelace's notes made it clear that she understood the Analytical Engine as well as Babbage himself,
 and she understood how to make it do the things computers do.
But more than that, Lovelace was a visionary: she understood that numbers could be 
used to represent more than just quantities, and a machine that could manipulate 
numbers could be made to manipulate any data represented by numbers. She predicted 
that machines like the Analytical Engine could be used to compose music, produce 
graphics, and be useful to science. Of course, all that came true—in another 100 years.

<h2>Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) </h2>
                <p>

                        Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) is an important subset of cryptography. It has the potential to enable real data privacy. SMPC seeks to find ways for parties to jointly compute a function using their inputs, while keeping these inputs private.

                        Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme:
                        
                        To understand SMPC, we must first understand Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme. The Scheme’s purpose is to divide and distribute one secret value over several nodes or users, so that no one knows anything about the secret value. To retrieve the secret value, a minimum quorum of users must pool their data together.
                        
                        Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme can also be used to perform computations on a secret shared value. When we group together the results of each user’s computations on their respective pieces of data, we arrive at the outcome of the computation — without knowing the secret inputs.
                        
                        
                        Secure Multi-Party Computation on Personal Data
                        
                        Now, instead of using a number, let’s say the ‘secret’ is a user’s personal data.
                        
                        SMPC works in much the same way: the personal data is split into several, smaller parts, each of which is masked using cryptographic techniques. Next, each small, encrypted piece of data is sent to a separate, independent server, so that each server only contains a small part of the data.
                        
                        An individual or organization looking to discover the ‘secret’ (i.e., uncover the personal data) will need to aggregate the encoded data.
                        
                        
                        
                        Implications for Privacy
                        
                        People have recently started demanding that governments and companies safeguard their personal information more proactively, especially financial, health, demographic, or other sensitive information. Large organizations are now looking to maintain their customers’ trust by being responsible guardians of their personal data.
                        
                        In these circumstances, SMPC’s combination of encryption, distribution, and distributed computation can have a profound impact on data privacy and security.
