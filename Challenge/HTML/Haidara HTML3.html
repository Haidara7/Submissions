                    <h4>Our Story</h4>
                        <hr>The Coffea Arabica, the most common. Most of the world's coffee is made from Arabica beans, and the Coffea Robusta, which is easier to grow in places where Arabica will not grow. Robusta is cheaper and has more caffeine than Arabica and it is used in many commercial coffee products.
                    </h4>
                    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. ... Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee</p>

                            <p>Paragraph's second location provides the same great coffee and friendly service but with a new atmosphere - owing to the larger amount of space, the more industrial appearance of the inside, the dim lighting in the evening, and the old fashioned furniture (including a piano which guests are welcome to play). Its also right next to the university which makes it a very convenient place to get good coffee during your break, or to study quietly.</p>

                            <p>Coffee trees are pruned short to conserve their energy and aid in harvesting, but can grow to more than 30 feet (9 meters) high. Each tree is covered with green, waxy leaves growing opposite each other in pairs. Coffee cherries grow along the branches. Because it grows in a continuous cycle, itâ€™s not unusual to see flowers, green fruit and ripe fruit simultaneously on a single tree</p>
